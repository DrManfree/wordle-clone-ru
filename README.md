# Wordle clone in russian language (super early working version).

Built using React and SCSS.

Code subject to change.

TODO:

- Mobile version (the game works on mobile, although the keyboard is a mess and you can't use the native keyboard to type)
- Error validation (display errors when typing an invalid word, etc.)
- Code refactoring (optimize logic, split app into different components)
- Style changes (animations, better fonts/colors, etc.)
- Additional features (hints, start new game without reloading, etc.)
